### Features
1. Software needs to have features so we need to create a list of features
	1. Feature list
	2. Feature list takes into account
		1. User Interviews and surveys
		2. Informal user analysis and discussion
		3. Early and cheap release of MVP
	3. Be creative 
2. Feature Description
	1. Needs to have the following:
		1. Input: input from user
		2. Activation: How the feature is activated
		3. Action: Description of how input data is processed
		4. Output: result of the user input and the system
3. One way of understanding users is using an imagined user or **persona**
	1. ex. for a dentist appointment management are:
		1. Dentists, receptionist, and patients
4. Details about the persona are put into a **persona description**
	1. Paint a picture, short and easy to read
	2. Describe user background and product usage
	3. Educational background and technical skills
	4. One way you could break up a persona is
		1. Personalization
		2. Job-related
		3. Relevance
		4. Education
### Scenarios
1. def'n: A narrative that describes how a user/group might use your systems
	1. No need to include everything in scenario 
	2. Simple description of a situation where a user is using a product's features to do something they want to do 
	3. Scenario's can range in detail from a few paragraphs to a page of text
2. **Elements of a scenario description:**
	1. Scenario name
	2. Overall objective
	3. Personas of actors involved in the scenarios
	4. Problem that can't be addressed by existing system
	5. What's involved in reaching the objective
	6. Possible ways that the problem could be tackled
3. When writing scenarios
	1. User centric scenarios
	2. Avoid technical details
	3. Comprehensive coverage
### Stories
1. def'n: User stories are more specific than scenarios
	1. Each user story focuses on a single functionality or need
	2. Standard format of a users tory:
		- "As a (role), I (want | need) to (do something)"
	3. Extended format with Justification:
		1. "As a (role), I (want | need) to (do something) sot that (reason)"
1. Users stories in planning
	1. Producing backlog as users tories
	2. Focus on implementable unit
	3. Managing complex feature
1. Sometimes a users story is too big and then it has to be broken up into more user stories and classified as an epic
