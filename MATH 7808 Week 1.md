# Introduction to Calculus

## What is Calculus
1. **Calculus:** Is the study of continuous quantities/things
	1. **Differential Calc:**
		1. Looks at the instantaneous rate of change of quantities/things
		2. Looks at the idea of how to find a tangent line to the graph of a quantity/thing at any point on the graph 
	2. **Integral Calc:**
		1. Looks at the accumulation of quantities/things.
		2. Looks at how to find areas under graphs of functions

## Functions
1. A function is a methematical model that descries how one quantity/thing influences another quantity/thing
	1. Domain (x)
		1. Set of all values of the input
	2. Codomain/Range (y)
		1. The set of all possible output values
	3. Rule
		1. Which output goes to a given input

## Function types
1. In this class we only care about 4 function types
	1. Polynomial Functions
	2. Trig Functions
	3. Exponential Functions
	4. Logarithmic Functions
